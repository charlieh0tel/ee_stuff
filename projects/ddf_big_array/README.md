# DDF Antenna Array Switching System

This is a broadband switching system for a 4-way pseudo-Doppler Direction Finding array.  The goal is to cover 2m and 70cm and ideally up to 33cm.  

There is a central switching board that provides bias distribution to the four antenna switches via coax.   Switched bias voltages to rotate the array can be delivered over CAT 5/6 into an RJ-45 jack.  

Each antenna switch board has a vertical SMA that will take a 1/4-wave SMA whip.  The board itself can be affixed to a ground plane to provide "the rest of the antenna."  

There is ESD protection on all the goes-in-to's and goes-out-of's.
