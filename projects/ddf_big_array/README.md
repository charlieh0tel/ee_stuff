# DDF Antenna Array Switching System

This is a broadband switching system for a 4-way pseudo-Doppler Direction Finding array.  
There is a central switching board that provides bias distribution to four antenna switches.   
The antenna switch boards have a vertical SMA that will take a 1/4-wave SMA whip and are designed to be affixed to a ground plane.
